Door lock system made to be used with VORP 2.0

Includes:
- Door lock animation.
- Door Status replaced with a nice "lock" sprite.
- Fixed kicking/slamming/running through doors.
- The doors State are synced even after a new player enters the server.

Info:
- Hold "ALT" to Open the Door.
- To add more doors edit config.lua (Most of the important doors are already here).
